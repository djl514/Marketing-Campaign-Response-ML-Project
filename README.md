# Marketing-Campaign-Response-ML-Project
This was the final project in ISM4641 at USF. Taking an open source Marketing Dataset from Kaggle.com, myself and a team worked on a regression analysis based on customer response (0-1) (Accepted/Declined)

Along with the Python Notebook is a detailed PowerPoint Presentation laying out the entire project.
